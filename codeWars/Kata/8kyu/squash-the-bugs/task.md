# Squash the bugs

Simple challenge - eliminate all bugs from the supplied code so that the code runs and outputs the expected value. Output should be the length of the longest word, as a number.

There will only be one 'longest' word.

    findLongest("The quick white fox jumped around the massive dog"),7;
    findLongest("Take me to tinseltown with you"), 10);
    findLongest("Sausage chops"), 7);
    findLongest("Wind your body and wiggle your belly"), 6);
    findLongest("Lets all go on holiday"), 7);
